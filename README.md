# fcc-tribute-page

This is one of FreeCodeCamp portfolio projects. This is a tribute page and my theme is Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. It's my first graduation and I'm glad that I was study there.

#### Stack
I used a bit more than just usual CSS and HTML, because I like tools that we have right now. So under the hood you can find:
`HTML`, `CSS`, `Parcel` - for bundling / and deploy optimisation and `gh-pages` for easy deploy.

To use it locally, just clone and run `npm i` or `yarn install`
